# Lorenz-Attractor-
A scalable two-dimensional graphical representation of a Lorenz Attractor system. 
This system uses Eulers method for solving systems of Ordinary Differential Equations,
there is some commented out code which steps through the ODE's with time-stepping to also create a curve, 
however, precsion is lacking there but the line-segments do create a smoother-looking curve using line-segments instead of points.
