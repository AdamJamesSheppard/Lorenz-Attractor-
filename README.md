# Lorenz-Attractor with 4th Order Runge-Kutta
A scalable two-dimensional graphical representation of a Lorenz Attractor system. 
This system uses the 4th order Runge-Kutta method for solving systems of Ordinary Differential Equations,
there is some commented out code which steps through the ODE's with time-stepping to also create a curve.
